/** kYearType
 *
 *  There are three kinds of Hebrew years, each
 *  having two possible configurations. They are:
 *
 *  A "defective year" (Chaser) is 353 days long.
 *  A "defective leap year" is 353 days.
 *
 *  A "common year" (Kesidran) is 354 days long.
 *  A "common leap year" is 384 days.
 *
 *  A "complete year" (Shalaim) is 355 days long.
 *  A "complete leap year" is 385 days long.
 *
 *  Another way of thinking about this is a composite
 *  of leap years (with 13 months instead of 12) and
 *  leap months. (Leap months contain 30 days instead 
 *  of the 29 they would otherwise contain. Two months
 *  of the Hebrew calendar can be leap months.)
